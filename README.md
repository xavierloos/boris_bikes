Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## Organise the nouns and verbs into Objects and Messages
| OBJECT | MESSAGE |RESPONSE|
|--------|---------||
|User|||
|Bike|is working?|TRUE/FALSE|
|DockingStation|Release_bike|BIKE|
## Draw a diagram that shows how your Objects will use Messages to communicate with one another
